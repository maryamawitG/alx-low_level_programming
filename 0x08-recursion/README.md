3, function that returns the factorial of a given number.
	Prototype: int factorial(int n);
	If n is lower than 0, the function should return -1 to indicate an error
	Factorial of 0 is 1
4,function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.
	Prototype: int _pow_recursion(int x, int y);
	If y is lower than 0, the function should return -1
5,function that returns the natural square root of a number.
	Prototype: int _sqrt_recursion(int n);
	If n does not have a natural square root, the function should return -
6, function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0
